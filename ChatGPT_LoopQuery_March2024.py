#----------------------------------------------
#REMEMBER TO RUN THESE PIP COMMANDS if you have an older OpenAI:
#pip uninstall openai
#Note: the command may look like this in your venv  C:\Python310\Scripts\pip install openai pandas python-dotenv

#----------------------------------------------
#RUN THESE COMMANDS FROM THE TERMINAL
#Create the virtual environment called "venv"
#python -m venv venv   

#from venv
#pip install openai==0.28 pandas python-dotenv

#Activate the venv 
#Windows command:
#venv\Scripts\activate
#MacOS or Linix command: 
#source chatgpt_env/bin/activate
